# gdx-Gnoblin
Gnoblin Engine is a 3D(2D is optional) game engine based on libgdx library

#For Developers
I may say - this is my training work through learning libgdx and game programming, and, if you really interested in developing and contributing this engine - you're welcome! If engine gets some popularity, I might join you and continue to work out this engine.
